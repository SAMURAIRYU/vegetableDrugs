Small claims
You still seem determined not to move. At your own risk, Freddy! Meanwhile, adversity is present, and if you wall yourself off in this infernal silence, it will eventually ruin your whole life completely with no turning back!

You cannot say the opposite, Freddy: this negative vortex pushes you to only look at the negative side of things, and your life is oriented on a dark slope with no end in sight.

Do you really want to continue on this path, Freddy? I can't quite bring myself to believe it. Know that you must only make a single gesture to benefit from a miraculous Angelic Process which is able to change everything for you.

You decide, Freddy! But you must act now!


Your friend,
Celeste
